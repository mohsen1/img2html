<h3>Why?</h3>
Why not?
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
Email clients do not show images by default. But most of them render HTML code. Sometimes it worth to make image file size bigger but be sure that image will show up in emails. Like a company logo.
<h3>Code</h3>
This is bad code. Written in a few hours.
<h3>What is next?</h3> 
 
 * Be smart to produce less code 
 * Make the actual `input type="file"` work
 * Clean up the code
 * Allow user to choose output HTML element(table, divs, etc)
